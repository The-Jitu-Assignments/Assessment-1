Constructive criticism

  This is key for your personal growth as an individual you get to be
  corrected from your mistakes and take the feedback positively. I think 
  being corrected is more important than being ignored even if you are messing up.
  This helps you to be a better human and think of how you can improve your 
  situation or behaviour in the end. Everyone should be willing to be criticised
  and take the criticism in a positive way instead of feeling bullied.
